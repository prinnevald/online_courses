This will be the real notes and not a script, because setting up a server is happening
using different technologies, though I want to expain it, not to automate.

So, first we install CentOS 7 (mininal is enough) onto the PC of our choice. For VM users,
4 gigabytes is plenty for the minimal installation

enter the root using "su"

next, we install nginx itself, php, php-fpm and other php dependencies.
if not installing properly out of the box, install epel-relase package to make
the list of possible installable packages longer.

	yum install nginx (or anything you are going to install)

main config file for the nginx is located at "/etc/nginx/" and is named "nginx.conf"
you will be editing this file in order to make your website run.

at this moment you can actually type "service nginx start" in the bash and your server will start.
from any local device go to your local IP (for me it was 192.168.1.4) and you will see the
default webpage saying something about CentOS.

congratulations! you have setup your own server.

the files of the website are located in "/usr/share/nginx/html" for me. The directory of
the booting website can be changed in the nginx.conf. It is labeled as "root" here.

so, in the config file you will meet a "location" block. Those are the webpages of the
website.
	
	location / {
	}

there "/" shows the main page of the website. However if you add this:
	
	location /anything {
	}

you will essentially create a new page called anything.
For me it would be: 192.168.1.4/anything

But, to access it we of course need files for the page itself, or it will be 404 or other error.

To do that create a directory "anything" in the /usr/share/nginx/yourwebsitedirectory
(assuming you have changed the root folder for the website)

now create an html called "index.html" in "anything" which will be responsible for this page

you are set! do:

	service nginx reload

and you can enter the page by your IP/anything and you will see whatever you have put inside
of the "index.html". But we want some action right?

To activate php-fpm we need to add another location for the config file:

	location ~ \.php*{
		include path-to/fastcgi_params;
		fastcgi_pass 127.0.0.1:9000;
		fastcgi_index index.php;
		fastcgi_param SCRIPT_FILENAME $document_root$fastcgi_script_name;
	}

and then bash:

	service php-fpm start

then change your index.html to according index.php and it will work fine. Well, have in mind
to change according "locations" in your configs.


To make javascript work:

	yum install nodejs

if I remember correctly. Hope that was it.
